**This page is mostly for folks *learning* Elm.** It aggregates questions that are commonly
asked on [the Slack channel][slack], [the IRC channel][irc], or [the mailing list][list].
Those are all friendly and helpful places to go if you do not find the answer to your
question here!

* Contributions to [this document](https://github.com/elm-community/elm-faq)
  are welcome!

* This document is about the current version of Elm (0.17). See also the
  [Elm 0.17 FAQ](17.html) about upgrading to Elm 0.17. See the [Elm 0.16 FAQ](16.html)
  about that older version of Elm.


### What is the difference between `type` and `type alias`?

`type` defines and names a new type (which behaves like an enum with data
attached), and `type alias` gives a name to an existing type.

`type alias` isn't creating a distinct type, it is literally just giving a name to an existing type. A type alias will save you keystrokes, but do nothing more. [ref](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/elm-discuss/YgRqI5s2S7Y)




### Why does elm-repl (or elm-make) report "cannot find module 'Html'"?
You need to install the Html module:

    elm package install elm-lang/html

Several modules are [available by default](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest) in the base Elm tools but other common modules like Html have to be installed in the working directory before they can be used in elm-make, elm-repl, and elm-reactor.



### Why does elm-repl report a syntax problem for any type annotation, such as for `fib : Int -> Int`?

elm-repl does not support type annotations at all. If you try you'll see a "syntax problem" message saying something like "I ran into something unexpected when parsing your code!" and pointing to the colon.

To use type annotations you will have to use elm-reactor or [elm-lang.org/try](http://elm-lang.org/try), or build and run a complete app.



### How do I know what package name to use for `elm package install`?
Search on [package.elm-lang.org](http://package.elm-lang.org/) for the module name and use the package name that you find there.



### How can I write debugging information to the console?
Wrap any value with `Debug.log “some message”` and that message and the value will be written to the javascript console every time the value is evaluated. For example:

```haskell
case Debug.log "action" action of
```

If you want to just log a message and value without using that value, try this in a `let` clause:

```haskell
_ = Debug.log "my message" someValue
```

Also see [`Debug.crash`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Debug#crash)
which gets special treatment from the compiler to provide additional information in the output.



### How do I install an older version of Elm, 0.16 for example?

    npm install -g elm@0.16

If you need to switch between multiple versions of elm, consider [elmenv](https://github.com/sonnym/elmenv).



### What does `=>` mean?
A common idiom is to define the `(=>)` operator as a synonym for the `(,)` operator that constructs tuples. This makes a shorthand for long lists of tuple pairs, often used with the Html.style property.  So `["color" => "red", "padding" => "2px"]` means `[("color", "red"), ("padding", "2px")]`.

Note: Operators cannot be defined in elm-repl.



### How can I output literal HTML and avoid escaping of entities?
Use the `innerHTML` property. For example:

```haskell
span [ property "innerHTML" (Json.Encode.string "&copy;") ] []
```



### What does `()` mean?

It is the empty tuple or [unit type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_type). It serves much like "void", "null", or "None" in other languages.



### What good is the `<|` operator if it is just function application?

It has lower precedence than function application expressed by adjacency (e.g. `sqrt x`) and is right-associative, and so it can be used instead of parentheses to group function arguments. For example, `a b ( c d )` is the same as `a b <| c d`, and `f ( g ( h x ) ) )` can be written as `f <| g <| h x`.  More concretely, `max 3 (sqrt x)` can be written as `max 3 <| sqrt x`. [^application]

[^application]: Function application and the `<|` operator are discussed at some length [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/elm-discuss/-PLj_eamKVQ/Zzo7iNx2FgAJ).

Note: The `<|` operator is essentially the same as `$` in Haskell.



### What are the Elm operator precedences and associativities?

See an [Elm operator precedence table](operators.html).
See also [Basics.elm](https://github.com/elm-lang/core/blob/master/src/Basics.elm).



### How can I use multiple Elm programs on the same page?

You can compile multiple modules into a single elm.js and then instantiate whatever module you need on the appropriate div. [^multipleModules]

    elm-make A.elm B.elm --output elm.js

[^multipleModules]: Use of multiple main modules in one application is discussed [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/elm-discuss/eEJgNnl99ps/keWXnn1KCwAJ).



### Why doesn't the Elm compiler find the Native code in a module that I cloned from github?

To use native code not installed by `elm-package` you need to add this to your elm-package.json file:

    "native-modules": true,



### Why, when I import a module that defines a type, does the compiler know about the type name but not its constructors?

You need to import the module like this:

    import MyModule exposing (MyType(..))

Just exposing `MyType` without the `(..)` will leave the constructors undefined.

Simillarly, the module itself must export the constructors.

    module MyModule exposing (MyType(..))

However, there are reasons for [keeping tags and record constructors secret](http://package.elm-lang.org/help/design-guidelines#keep-tags-and-record-constructors-secret).



### Where can I use type annotations?

In addition to the top-level, type annotations can also be applied to `let` expressions.

```haskell
let
  hypotenuse : Float -> Float -> Float
  hypotenuse a b =
    sqrt (a^2 + b^2)
in
  hypotenuse 3 4
```



### How can I join the elmlang.slack.com community?
Sign up at [elmlang.herokuapp.com](http://elmlang.herokuapp.com/).



### How can I recover when elm-make fails with errors like "... openFile: does not exist"?

That can happen when switching between elm versions. Try removing all of elm-stuff or just the build-artifacts:

    rm -r elm-stuff/build-artifacts



### How do I install an Elm package that has not been published to packages.elm-lang.org for use in my project?

Clone the package into a separate directory and add its directory path to the `source-directories` section of the elm-package.json file for your project. As usual, you will also have to install any dependencies of the package. If the package includes any native javascript code you will have to also add `native-modules: true` to elm-package.json.



### How can I parse Json into Elm data?

Currently you have to write the [parsing
code](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Json-Decode).
Other than for [data passed over ports](http://elm-lang.org/guide/interop#customs-and-border-protection) there is no automatic conversion (and even
there, experts recommend writing the parser manually to be able to handle error
cases).

The [json-to-elm](https://github.com/eeue56/json-to-elm) tool is a Python script that generates Elm code to parse a given example of Json.

There are additional Json parsing tools in the [elm-json-extra](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/circuithub/elm-json-extra/latest/Json-Decode-Extra) package.

The [Elm Json Decode interpreter](http://simonh1000.github.io/decoder/) is an online tool allowing you to experiment with decoders and test them in a simple context.



### How can I report a compiler error message that could be better?

Report the problem at the [error-message-catalog issue tracker](https://github.com/elm-lang/error-message-catalog/issues)
with an [short, self-contained, correct, example](http://sscce.org/) showing both the program and the problematic error messages.



### Does Elm have HashMaps?

The core [Dict](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Dict) package provides a dictionary mapping unique keys to values. There are some restrictions on key value types; in particular, records cannot be keys.
